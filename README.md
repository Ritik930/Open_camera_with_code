# Open_camera_with_code
Camera open using Python code.
The given code utilizes OpenCV library in Python to perform real-time face detection on a video stream from the webcam. Here's a description of the code:

1. Importing Libraries: The necessary libraries, including `cv2`, are imported.

2. Loading Cascade Classifier: The Haar cascade classifier XML file is loaded using the `cv2.CascadeClassifier` function. The XML file contains pre-trained data for detecting cat faces.

3. Initializing Video Capture: The code initializes video capture from the default webcam using `cv2.VideoCapture(0)`.

4. Main Loop: The program enters a while loop to continuously capture frames from the video stream.

5. Reading Frames: The `video_cap.read()` function is used to read frames from the video stream. The return value `ret` indicates if the frame was successfully read, and `video_data` contains the captured frame.

6. Face Detection: The loaded cascade classifier is applied to detect faces in the `video_data` frame using the `face_cap.detectMultiScale()` function. It returns a list of rectangles specifying the positions of the detected faces.

7. Drawing Rectangles: For each detected face, a green rectangle is drawn around it using the `cv2.rectangle()` function.

8. Displaying Video: The processed frame with the drawn rectangles is displayed using the `cv2.imshow()` function.

9. Exiting the Program: The program waits for a key press, and if the 'x' key is pressed, the loop breaks, and the program releases the video capture and closes any open windows.

The code continuously captures frames from the webcam, applies face detection, and displays the processed frames with detected faces in real-time.
